# Revision-Helper
Small software made by me to aid revision

3 File included:

-Revision Helper.exe (A launcher for both other files if you choose to use that)

-Notes.exe (A program for organising notes into subjects and topics)

-Cards.exe (A program to make revision cards with and play back random ones to revise)

All 3 files seem to get flagged by antiviruses so here are the reports from VirusTotal.com:
